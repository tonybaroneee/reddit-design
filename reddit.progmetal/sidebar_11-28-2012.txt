**When linking to music:** think about accompanying your submission with a comment relative to your post. While this isn't mandatory, it is highly encouraged as it helps get discussions going.

If your post doesn't show up it might have gone in the spam folder. Message the mods to get it approved.

#Rules 

* Please use the search function before posting music. If your song has already been submitted within the last 6 months it isn't allowed.

* Please don't link to illegal content (torrents/downloads of albums that are not already free to download).  Streaming audio (youtube, grooveshark, etc.) is fine as long as there are no downloads.

* Please do not post memes. Take them to [r/metalmemes](http://reddit.com/r/metalmemes) instead.

* Please do not post images. Because of the nature of image links, they tend to be upvoted more than any other type of post. This clogs up our "top posts of all time" page with many image submissions, regardless of post quality. If you absolutely need to submit a picture, please do so in a self-post.

* Please don't post full album streams. Pick one song from an album to showcase.  (exceptions for promotional album streams of new releases).

* Please add Band Name - Song Title to your music post titles.
