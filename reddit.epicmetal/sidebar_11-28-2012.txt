A subreddit dedicated to the grandest of metal. Here we post and discuss metal that is epic in any sense of the word, be it melody, song structure, or otherwise. It does not matter what subgenre it is. As long as it is epic, it is welcome.

Ideally, this is a community of [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/help/reddiquette), **where we don't downvote those we disagree with. If you don't like what someone posts, just say so.**
